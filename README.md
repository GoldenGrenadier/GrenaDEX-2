# GrenaDEX-2
This is code from the GrenaDEX 2.1 that has been modified to use the Xinput Teensy library. With this firmware the controller becomes, for all intents and purposes,an Xbox 360 controller(barring actual console use). The hardware lacks L3, R3, select and home buttons but in the future a few tact switches may be added to compensate.
