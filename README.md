# GrenaDEX-2
This is an upgraded version of my Grenadex 1 controller. Hardware wise it is a dreamcast controller with a second analog stick taken from another dreamcast controller. As per the GrenaDEX 1 the GrenaDEX 2 uses the original circuitry of the controller including the hall effect sensors used for analog input. Sadly the VMU socket had to go in order to make room for the second stick. Maybe I'll put a small LCD there for effect.
The code is vastly improved over its predicessor but isn't quite perfect. In order for it to be easily transplanted into another project of different hardware, the code has been written to be more modular. The biggest improvement is the way analog input is handled.
